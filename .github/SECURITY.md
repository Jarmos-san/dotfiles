**For any security concerns please refer to this.**

This repository hosts the Shell scripts I use to handle creation/manipulation of the dotfiles on my personal development machines. When executed they download certain applications from the Internet & perform certain file manipulations. Hence use the scripts from this repository with discretion. The owner of this repository will not be held responsible for any damage and/or unintended actions to your personal development machine.

But, if you're willing to use the scripts from this repository & find a bug or two, please report it to the owner immediately. You can drop an email or leave him a tweet at--[@Jarmosan](https:twitter.com/jarmosan).

You can also open a PR if you think there's an urgent security concern. Please refer to the [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to contribute to the project.
